# Displaying-clock-on-OLED

In this task we will fetch time from internet using NTP server and display it on OLED screen. The advantage of using internet clock is that it reduces the hardware required.

### What is NTP?
Network time protocol (NTP) is a network protocol used for synchronization of time between systems and data network. In this task we use this NTP server to get the time.

### What is OLED?
OLED is an organic light emitting diode. OLEDs are the future as they possess some of the greatest advantages over conventional LED’S and LCD’S. The most attractive thing about using OLED’S are they don’t need backlight like conventional LED/LCD screens. The organic material itself has the property known as electroluminance, which causes the material to glow when stimulated by current.
